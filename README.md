practicing my html css and js
Peopla say its amonng the easiest but doing it without a youtuber to folow really makes you realize how difficult it is but as soon as i started ,i got to learn more and more about what it truly means to become as software engineer

I really enjoyed every step of making this (almost threw my laptop)╰(*°▽°*)╯ but thats what makes coding interesttting for me,I love the challange  and the freedom of creativity it gives me.

Shout out to google,discord,stack overflow and chatgpt for all the assistance they gave me to help me understand the errors i kept making!!
